## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the core functionality of a blog platform, allowing users to register, authenticate, post blog entries, and leave comments on posts. It was created to help learn Flask and its ecosystem, including database interactions with SQLAlchemy and user session management using Flask-Login.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
- **Create Posts**: Logged-in users can create blog posts with a title and body.
- **View Posts**: All users, whether logged in or not, can view posts and their associated comments.
- **Comments**: Logged-in users can leave comments on posts.
- **Responsive UI**: Basic styling with HTML and CSS (can be extended).

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (with Jinja2 templating)
- **Database**: SQLite (can be switched to PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for user sessions and password hashing

## Setup and Installation

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (`venv`)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/flask-blog-app.git
    cd flask-blog-app
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add a `SECRET_KEY` for session management and a `DATABASE_URL` for your database connection. Here's an example of `.env`:
    ```bash
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///blog.db
    ```

5. **Create the database**:
    Run the `create_db.py` script to initialize the database schema:
    ```bash
    python create_db.py
    ```

## Running the Application

After completing the setup:

1. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
